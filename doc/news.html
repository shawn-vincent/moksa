<h2>Old News (Olds!?)</h2>

  <p><em>New news comes out on the <a
  href="http://www.svincent.com/moksa/">main web page</a></em></p>

<h3>December 8th, 1999: Evaluation of Mercury</h3>

  <p>The latest update updates the IO primitives a bit, cleaning them
  up.  It's not done, by a long shot, but something's come up.</p>

  <p>After writing a bunch of Prolog code, I discovered a programming
  language called <a
  href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/index.html">Mercury</a>.
  Mercury is a generalization of Prolog with two significant
  advantages (for me).  First, it is rigorously typed, allowing
  serious compile-time optimizations.  Second, it is entirely logical
  (without any of Prolog's imperative functionality).</p>

  <p>Mercury intrigues me.  I am evaluating it now, reading their
  online papers, and playing with their compiler to write programs,
  and it's an exciting language.  I truly disliked Prolog's dynamic
  type system: I am an earnest believer in static typing -- in Java,
  once your program compiles, it often just runs.  Apart from anything
  else, Mercury is a much <em>faster</em> language than Prolog, and
  this interests me as well.</p>

  <p>What does this mean for Moksa?  Well, that's yet to be seen.  I
  may port Mercury to a Java framework, or I may give up on it after
  my evaluation and go back to pure Prolog.  We shall see.</p>

<h3>December 2nd, 1999: Freedom from JavaClass -- enter the Rhino</h3>

  <p>Well, it's done.  I've officially removed any need for users to
  download and install extra software when they run Moksa:
  everything's in one small-ish (0.5M) JAR file.</p>

  <p>The answer?  I used to depend on <a
  href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/~dahm/JavaClass/">JavaClass</a>, a
  package for reading and manipulating Java class files.  JavaClass is
  a good package, but it was overkill for my needs (for example, I
  don't need to parse or edit existing class files), and so was larger
  and heavier-weight than I might have liked.  It also allowed more
  flexibility by representing each instruction as an object, which I
  couldn't really afford.</p>

  <p>Anyway, after a couple grueling days, I've switched over to use
  the bytecode engine out of <a
  href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a>.  I don't use the
  stock version (it has dependencies on Rhino, proper, and I had a few
  mutes I had to make to it so it could generate everything I needed,
  plus I don't want to conflict with existing installs of Rhino), but
  it provided nearly all the functionality I needed, at a very low
  cost.  See the package <code>com.svincent.smalljava.rhino</code> for
  more information.</p>

  <p>With the shackles of 3rd party libraries gone, I finally made my
  Makefile generate a JAR file for distribution:
  <code>moksa.jar</code> is now available for putting in your
  <code>CLASSPATH</code> or invoking with the <code>-jar</code> option
  of the <code>java</code> utility.</p>

  <p>Anyway.  Next steps?  More cleanup.  Ultimately, I want to
  improve performance by changing the compiler to not create so many
  objects in the invocation of a Rule.  Once I feel sufficiently
  ambitious, I'll do that.  In the meantime, I want to clean the whole
  beast up.</p>

<h3>November 30th, 1999: Cleanup + Refactoring!</h3>

  <p>General cleanup.  Moksa had gotten gross with silt and some poor
  design decisions early on.  Some of that has been removed.  In
  particular, the class <code>com.svincent.moksa.Wam</code> used to be
  the center of the universe, doing all sorts of unrelated things.
  Now its functinality has been seperated out into three classes:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><code>Wam</code> - exactly an implementation of a WAM: no
      more, no less</li>

      <li><code>PrologEngine</code> - the top-level class with the
      public interface + subsystems such as the package manager and
      I/O.</li>

      <li><code>PrologFactory</code> - a factory for creating various
      objects used by Moksa (particularly <code>PrologTerm</code>s and
      <code>Continuation</code>s.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Much nicer.  Plus another round of documenting some of the code,
  and a release.  Next step?  Probably to remove my dependency on the
  JavaClass API.  I want to be self-sufficient.  I'm going to look at
  the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> bytecode
  generation API.  It has an API inside of it that seems small and
  pleasant: the main deal is only 1500 lines of code.  Shouldn't be a
  problem to use it, either: it's under the fairly liberal MPL.</p>


<h3>November 25th, 1999: ANTLR is gone!</h3>

  <p>I just removed the dependency on ANTLR that I had.  No more ANTLR
  grammars for me: I've now got two.  The next step is to hook up the
  Prolog-based parser, and to add an option to Prologc that can switch
  between them.  Plus lots of improvements.</p>

<h3>November 24th, 1999: New Parser and Package Manager</h3>

  <p>Things are coming along nicely.  I finished a pure-Prolog parser
  to replace the ANTLR-based parser I have currently.  It's not hooked
  up, yet, but it will be.</p>

  <p>Also, lots of commenting, general improvements, and headway
  towards removing gross things that have crept in.  I figured it was
  time for a release to give myself a bit of a break from heads-down
  programming.  I've also re-engineered the web site a bit, wrote a
  touch more documentation (or at least rearranged that which was
  already there, and brought back some from older and better days),
  and just generally improved things.</p>

  <p>Anyway, tonight is my night to watch TV (Hercules and Xena: the
  only shows I ever watch, and tonight's Hercules is the final episode
  of the series!  Gasp!), so I'll get as much done as possible, and
  probably dothe actual release tomorrow.</p>

<h3>November 17th, 1999: Repackaged things</h3>

  <p>It came to my attention that the distribution of MoksaProlog that
  was put up yesterday didn't work.  Go figure.  Anyway, it's all
  repackaged, life is good, and I'm reworking how the web site works.
  You can <em>really</em> <a
  href="http://www.svincent.com/moksa/dist/moksa-0.2.zip">download</a>
  Moksa now.</p>

  <p>And in lieu of documentation, here's a quick tutorial in using
  MoksaProlog.</p>

  <p>Simplified Usage:</p>
  <pre>
     java -jar moksaProlog.jar [-src prolog-file] [-rule rule-def] [-goal goal]
  </pre>

  <p>The other option you might be interested in is
  <code>-help</code>.  It prints a help message and exits the
  compiler.  That's where all the options are documented.</p>

  <p>So, for example, using the <code>test.pl</code> source file
  distributed with MoksaProlog, you could type:</p>

  <pre>
      java -jar moksaProlog.jar -src test.pl -goal &quot;append ([a, b], [c], L).&quot;
  </pre>

  <p>And get</p>

  <pre>
      MoksaProlog 0.1 Ready.
      That''s all folks!
      Did append, got [a, b, c, d, e, f]
      'append ([a, b], [c], L).' succeeded with bindings:
           L = [a, b, c]
  </pre>

  <p>Pretty super.  Go nuts.  I apologize for the lack of an
  interactive environment.  That'll be one of the next things I
  do.</p>

<h3>November 16th, 1999: MoksaProlog does Compilation</h3>

  <p>Step 2 is done.  I got up really early this morning, and added
  dynamic compilation to bytecodes to MoksaProlog.  Plus, I added
  command line options, and everything.</p>

  <p>Soon I'll package it up nicely so that it's easier to compile (it
  currently depends on 2 packages, ANTLR and JavaClass, which aren't
  distributed with it -- this will change)</p>

  <p>What's left?  Well, cleanup, solidification, and general
  improvements.  Complete ISO Prolog support.  Add extensions.</p>

  <p>And finally, extend to support true Moksa stuff: constraint logic
  programming.</p>

  <p>Soon, soon, soon....</p>

<h3>November 15th, 1999: First release of MoksaProlog</h3>

  <p>It's buggy, it's shaky, it's really alpha (0.1), but it works,
  and implements nearly all of core Prolog (minus many of the builtin
  terms).  I stick it here for public amusement, not widespread use.
  It is, of course, being distributed under the <a
  href="doc/gpl.html">Gnu Public License</a>.</p>

  <p>What's MoksaProlog, you ask?  Well, I'm glad you did.
  MoksaProlog is the first (very early) release of a new 100% Java
  Prolog environment.  It runs with JDK1.2, and will ultimately
  support all of ISO Prolog.  <a
  href="mailto:svincent@svincent.com">Bug reports</a> would be
  appreciated.</p>

  <p>It will eventually have many useful extensions.  Even this early
  alpha release has some primitive facilities for interacting with
  Java objects from Prolog.  Internet I/O will be implemented,
  including such wonderful things like XML processing,
  sending/receiving mail, etc.  Some interesting mechanism for
  dynamically loading modules off of the Internet will be supported,
  also.</p>

  <p>MoksaProlog is just the beginning, however.  I'm only writing
  this Prolog environment as a basis for Moksa, which is my constraing
  logic programming language for generating random content for
  roleplaying games.  Overkill, I admit, but I don't like half-hearted
  solutions.</p>

  <p>What's next on my plate?  Well, first thing is to integrate
  Smalljava into the main interpreter, so that terms can be
  dynamically (and statically) compiled into Java source and/or
  bytecodes.  After that, probably rewrite the parser in Prolog (the
  current parser is the ugliest thing I've ever seen), build an
  interactive environment, then go nuts writing all the ISO Prolog
  builtin terms.</p>

  <p>After I have a reasonably complete and efficient Prolog
  environment, I'll add the final constaint programming features that
  will turn it into Moksa.  Then, it shall be complete.  And Moksa
  shall walk the earth, and God will see that it is good.</p>

  <p>&quot;Blurring the line between subjective and objective
  reality,&quot; indeed.</p>

<h3>Older News: First release of Smalljava</h3>

  <p><a href="doc/smalljava/">Smalljava</a> is a Java API for
  generating bytecodes in a natural, convenient way.</p>

  <p>Once Smalljava is stable, work will begin on MoksaProlog, a 100%
  Java Prolog environment, which will become the basis of Moksa.</p>
