How I generate the distribution for 3d6 (and others)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>How does one generate the distribution for rolling
<code>s</code>-sided dice <code>r</code> times?  If you think about
it, this is equivalent to finding the coefficients of the expanded
expression:</p>

<p class=indented>
    (1+x+x<sup>2</sup>+ ... +x<sup>s</sup>)<sup>r</sup> (1)
</p>

<p>Straightforward, eh?  Well, anyway, this next section demonstrates
an efficient algorithm for computing these coefficients.  (I'm open to
comments.  Anybody have a better way?)</p>

<p>Note that the obvious solution to this, counting in base 's', is
extremely inefficient (i.e. - O(S<sup>N</sup>)), and as a result,
completely unreasonable.
</p>

<h2>How to calculate those damned coefficients</h2>

<p>Some identities demonstrate that</p>

<p class=indented>
    (1) == [(1-x<sup>s+1</sup>) / (1-x)]<sup>r</sup> (2)<br>
    (2) == (1-x<sup>s+1</sup>)<sup>r</sup> * [1 / (1-x)]<sup>r</sup> (3)<br>
</p>

<p> Now say that </p>

<p class=indented>
    A == (1-x<sup>s+1</sup>)<sup>r</sup> (4)<br>
    B == [1 / (1-x)]<sup>r</sup> (5)<br>
</p>

<p> (So that <code>(2) == A * B</code>) </p>

<p>In the next section, we define C(n, r) == n! / (r! * (n-r)!).  This
is the standard 'n choose r' thing we keep hearing about.</p>

<p>Some more identities tell us the following:</p>

<p class=indented>
    A == 1 - C(r, 1)*x<sup>s+1</sup> + C(r, 2)*x<sup>2(s+1)</sup> + ... +
           (-1)<sup>k</sup> * C(r, k) * x<sup>k(s+1)</sup> + ... +
           (-1)<sup>r</sup> * C(r, r) * x<sup>r(s+1)</sup><br>
    B == 1 + C(1+r-1, 1)*x + ... + C(k+r-1, k)*x<sup>k</sup> + ...
</p>

<p>
But now we know that <code>(2) == A * B</code>, and more to the point,
<code>(1) == A * B</code>!  This is what we need.  Finding the
coefficients in <code>A * B</code> turns out to be really easy, and
cheap.
</p>

<p>To find the coefficient of x<sup>v</sup> in A * B, just choose from
A all those coefficients for powers of x<sup>i</sup> in A such that
<code>i < v</code>.  Then, for each of these coefficients, choose the
coefficient of x<sup>j</sup> in B such that <code>i+j == v</code>.
Then just multiply the two coefficients together.  Sum all of these
products, and you have the coefficient of x<sup>v</sup>!
</p>

<p>I believe that this is O(N<sup>2</sup>), although I could be
convinced otherwise.
