<hr>

  <p>(Unfortunately, the history isn't brief, but my description will
  have to be)</p>

<h2>In The Beginning...</h2>

  <p>I started playing RPGs years and years ago: my first ventures
  into the field were as far back as '83 (which might not be all that
  long ago to old-timers in the gaming community, but it seems long
  ago to me). I&nbsp;played Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons, moving along
  to Advanced D&amp;D, and recently branching out into other gaming
  systems.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning, however, my interest in computers forced me
  to think that there had to be some way to automatically generate
  characters with the computer. Typically, this is a process which can
  take hours, and will likely consume your entire first gaming session
  (A character that you expect to play for years isn't a trivial
  thing, and you want to be sure you don't make mistakes that'll bite
  you later). It's essentially applying deterministic rules, to
  generate stats, and looks automatable (don't get me wrong: I'm a
  stong believer in detailed character histories, personalities, and
  the like, but I'd rather not spend days figuring out what the
  correct bonuses for a 16 strength are this week, if I'm a
  dwarf).</p>

<h2>The First Attempt...</h2>

  <p>So, naturally, I wrote one. It looks pretty easy. My first
  attempt was a really gross Pascal program written with the help of
  my friend, <a href="http://access.mbnet.mb.ca/~gargoyle">Christian
  Schlosser</a>. It was buggy, and was never really finished, and made
  liberal use of massive global arrays (we actually had to increase
  the static allocated memory the compiler gave the program to its
  maximum value, and still were running into problems).  It was then
  that I discovered that it wasn't nearly as easy as I'd hoped.  (I
  don't even know where the code for that program went, now)</p>

<h2>The Miriad Attempts</h2>

  <p>Since then, I've worried on the problem (for those who are
  interested, that was 1989-90). I came up with the basic ideas behind
  what I wanted out of (what was then called) TAGS a year or two ago,
  but the way that I was thinking about it was wrong, and wouldn't
  work.</p>

<h2>The Beginning of the End...</h2>

  <p>Sometime in late '94, early '95, I had the basic idea down pat. I
  wasn't sure it would work (what about nondeterminism??), but I was
  on the right track, and actually cornered one of my statistics profs
  at the University of Waterloo to help me work through some of the
  more technical math issues.  The name came around then, too, when I
  was thinking about characters as collections of tagged values (which
  are now termed 'variables', and 'tags' are something else
  altogether...but I figured I'd keep the word around somewhere, since
  the project <em>is</em> named that). I had a nondeterministic
  algorithm in my head for the core char generation routine, which
  evolved into the one used today. About a month after this, however,
  I gave up my idea as hopeless, because I thought it couldn't be
  done.</p>

  <p>In November or December of '95, however, I picked it up again
  when I found some slides that I'd used for a presentation of TAGS to
  my Independent Studies class earlier in the year. I was explaining
  it to a friend (either <a
  href="http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/u/wwiewior/">Victor
  Wiewiorowski</a> or <a href="http://www.vrolyk.org/jp/">John Paul
  Vrolyk</a>, I don't remember) and couldn't figure out why it was
  impossible.  After careful consideration, I decided that it wasn't,
  actually, and I had just made a mistake in my reasoning. So it came
  back to life.</p>

  <p>I worked through most of the details of the previous incarnation
  of TAGS with my roommates (<a
  href="http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/u/wwiewior/">Victor</a>, <a
  href="http://www.vrolyk.org/jp">John Paul</a>, and
  <a href="http://diviner.com/~cbthiess">
  Chris Thiessen</a>), and it was actually JP that came up with the
  amazing name (the Totally Automated Generation System) that TAGS was
  the acronym of.</p>

  <p>I worked on this C++ version for a while, before giving up on it.
  It wasn't quite right.  I had the idea that I needed to propogate
  deterministic sets around, and stuff like that, but I didn't
  understand exactly how.  I actually got this version sort of working,
  limping along, but finally gave up, getting engrossed in school and
  work, and not having amazing success near the end.</p>


<h2>The Wonders of Java, and the Current Incarnation...</h2>

  <p>Then one day I heard the magical words: &quot;Constraint
  Satisfaction Problem&quot;, and my life has never been the same
  since.  It turns out that hundreds of AI researchers have been
  working on this problem for years!  So, I read up on it, and finally
  took a course in AI, and one lecture dedicated to CSP's did the
  trick.  The concepts of TAGS crystallized in my mind, and I hacked
  out a quick version in three days in Java.</p>

  <p>Over the next couple of weeks, I worked on it, and finally
  version 0.2 was released on the Internet.</p>


<h2>Disaster strikes, and a New Hope, with a New Name</h2>

  <p>Some months after playing around with Constraint Satisfaction
  Problems as a way to generate random content, I discovered some
  fatal flaws.  TAGS was turning into a programming language, but it
  wasn't a very <em>nice</em> programming language, as languages go.
  It was weak and ineffectual.  So, this made me rethink what I was
  doing.  I read and pondered, and gave up, and tried again.
  Eventually, I settled on something called &quot;Constraint Logic
  Programming&quot;.  This is a programming paradigm based on
  constraints: just like TAGS was a programming paradigm based on
  constraints.</p>

  <p>At about the same time, I was taking a Religions of the East
  course, and discovered an amazing term: <em>Moksa</em>.  It means
  &quot;To escape from the cycle of death and rebirth.&quot; This is
  just what I wanted to do, so I've changed the name.  So TAGS is now
  Moksa.</p>

  <p>Moksa is a logic programming language, based roughly on Prolog,
  or CLP(FD).  The only thing you can do in a language like this is
  specify primitive constraints, like <code>X=3</code>, or <code>A = B
  + C</code>, and define new user constraints, such as:</p>

  <pre>
      grandfather (G, X) :- 
         father (G, Y), father (Y, X).
  </pre>

  <p>(This says that 'G' is the grandfather of 'X' if 'G' is the
  father of 'Y' and 'Y' is the father of 'X').</p>

  <p>Using rules like this, we can build up complex constraint
  networks, that constrain the random content.</p>

<h2>The Final Stretch (we can only hope)</h2>

  <p>Finally, after writing a complete working version based on naive
  approaches to Prolog implementation, I bit the bullet and started to
  write a WAM-based version.</p>

  <p>Relatively quickly, I had a working simple Prolog environment,
  and I'm working towards making it robust, clean, simple, fast, and
  ISO-compliant.  After that, it will be a simple matter to add the
  features that will create the greatest random gaming content utility
  of all time.</p>

  <p>Well, possibly not the greatest, but <em>certainly</em> the most
  over-engineered.  I just hope somebody uses it, in the end.</p>

  <p>And Moksa is becoming reality.</p>

  <p>And God saw that it was Good.</p>
