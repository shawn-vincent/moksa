Asked Questions List (with answers!)</h1>

<hr>

<h2>What is Moksa?</h2>

  <p> Moksa started as an effort to create a useful character
  generator for the Advanced Dungeons&amp;Dragons gaming system.  It
  can do that, but it has become much more than that. </p>

  <p>Moksa is a system-independent, customizable, easily portable,
  powerful, and, above all, <em>useful</em> character generation
  utility for role-playing games.</p>

  <p>Moksa can also create most other forms of random content for
  roleplaying games, or anything else you might like to have random
  content for.<p>

  <p>I use it to decide which restaurant I will lunch at.</p>

  <p>Moksa is free (and will <em>always</em> be free, under the <a
  href="gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>), and is written by
  me (Shawn Vincent).</p>

  <p>It is available from <a href="http://www.svincent.com/moksa/">

<h2>Why another character generation utility?</h2>

  <p>Many will undoubtedly ask this question: why would I bother to
  write yet another character generation utility, when literally
  dozens already exist, and are freely available for download!?  </p>

  <p>I've used most of the existing character generators on the 'net,
  and nearly all of them suffer from one or more of the following (in
  my opinion) fatal flaws: </p>

  <ul style="margin-left: 4em;">
  <li><strong>Inflexible attribute generation order</strong>. Most of
  the existing utilities force the user to decide on things about the
  character in a particular order: first attribute scores, then class,
  then race, whatever. People like me, however, when they write up a
  character by hand, start out with some set of restrictions (say: I
  want a fighter today, and I get 3,000 XP to start with), and then
  build the character. These programs don't help at all in these
  cases. Moksa will. </li>

  <li><strong>Forced interactivity</strong>. Most of the current
  utilities assume that you're going to be sitting there throughout
  the char. generation process, to answer questions. Generating 100
  characters, 60% of whom are fighters, and 40% of whom are clerics,
  would be unthinkable in this system. Moksa will do this. </li>

  <li><strong>Tethered to a single gaming system</strong>. Most of the
  current utilities are game-system specific. That is, they only work
  to generate characters for AD&amp;D, or they only work to generate
  characters for Paranoia, etc.  Moksa will generate characters for
  any and all game systems, if you feed it the rules of that
  system. </li>

  <li><strong>No support for house rules</strong> Some of the
  utilities I've seen support minor house rules modifications, but
  nothing too useful. Since the rules are all arbitrary to Moksa
  anyway, any house rule can be specified. I'll have to be careful to
  make the rule specification language easy to learn/use, though. In
  addition, Moksa will tag each rule with page number/supplement ID,
  and you will be able to turn on/off various supplements for your
  gaming system (&quot;I don't want to generate characters with
  oriental proficiencies&quot;, etc). </li>
  </ul>

  <p> In short, the current utilities available didn't serve
  <em>my</em> needs, and so I decided to go all out and overkill the
  problem. &lt;chuckle&gt; </p>


<h2>You said &quot;Random Content Generation&quot;.  Whazzat?</h2>

  <p>Well, in the course of over-engineering Moksa, I discovered that
  it was good for generating things other than characters.  If you
  want to generate tavern menus, random bibles, random music for
  national anthems, or even decide what resaurant you're going to go
  to today, Moksa can help you out.</p>

<h2>&lt;snicker&gt;....that's just a pipe dream!</h2>

  <p>Sounds like it, doesn't it? The utopia of character generators?
  Can't be written? Stupid Vincent character, muttering to himself
  about impossibilities?</p>

  <p>Well, it's true. I've figured out how to do it: <br>Moksa is
  based on the concept of <em>constraint satisfaction programming
  </em>. That is, it is an engine which searches efficiently through
  the space of characters, using symbolic math whose basic constants
  are random distributions.</p>

  <p>Many gaming systems have attributes whose values are based,
  somehow, on a random value. Taking, for instance, AD&amp;D (my
  personal expertise lies mostly there), Constitution is defined to be
  3d6. This generates a bell curve, centered roughly on 9. A table
  lookup on this value gives you the constitution HP bonus, which is
  some small constant. This is also a bell curve, centered on 0, with
  it's low value being some small negative constant, and its high
  value being some small positive constant. See? Now, assume that
  classes are determined randomly, according to some distribution.  A
  table lookup on class will give you hit dice.</p>

  <p>Hit Points, then, can be viewed as a random distribution of
  values, derived from the random distributions of hit dice,
  constitution HP bonus, level, and whatever other factors come into
  play.</p>

  <p>All of these relations can be described mathematically. This is
  the basis of Moksa. Given a bunch of rules and initial random
  distributions, and possibly some restrictions on the initial random
  distributions, generate particular values for all of the attributes
  making up a character.</p>

  <p>Viewed this way, reverse-engineering game system rules is a
  fairly simple mathematical process, as long as the random
  distribution libraries exist and work well.  In fact, CSPs have been
  studied in the field of AI for years, and are used extensively in
  applications such as scheduling.</p>

  <p>So Moksa isn't so much of a pipe dream, after all. In fact, there
  is <em>significant</em> progress made on it already.  You can get a
  (very alpha-quality) running version at <a
  href="http://www.svincent.com/moksa/">
  http://www.svincent.com/moksa/</a></p>


<h2>What's the status on Moksa?</h2>

  <p>Moksa is currently in very-pre-alpha mode, and doesn't do most of
  the things I claim for it: yet.  Keep an eye on the <a
  href="http://www.svincent.com/moksa/">web page</a> for info and
  updates...</p>

<h2>How much does Moksa cost?</h2>

  <p>When I finish Moksa, I will release it, and the source-code for
  free, under the <a href="gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
  The UI and the rule spec. language are going to be very isolated
  from the rest of the engine.  Moksa is written in JAVA, and so will
  be very easy (one might say trivial) to port.</p>

  <p>I am also <a href="download.html"> releasing prerelease versions
  of Moksa for public examination</a>.  Like the final system, these
  are free and under the <a href="gpl.html">GPL</a>, and full source
  code is (of course) available.</p>

  <p>Although Moksa is free, under the <a href="gpl.html">GPL</a>,
  I've always thought it would be neat if people would send me nifty
  things.  Take a look at the <a
  href="giraffeware.html">GiraffeWare</a> page.</p>

  <p>When I finish it, I'll post to rec.games.frp.dnd-util about its
  availability. I will also post updates here.</p>

<h2>Wow!  Neat!  How can I help!?</h2>

  <p>If you're a programmer, and add a neat feature to Moksa, and send
  it off to me, I'll take a look at it, and maybe incorporate it into
  Moksa.  Since Moksa is under the <a href="gpl.html">GPL</a>, your
  changes will be freely available, just like Moksa itself.</p>

  <p>The more people contribute, the better Moksa can become.  This is
  the joy of Free Software.</p>

  <p>In general, though, I'm looking for feedback on how I can make
  Moksa better and more subservient to your needs.  Any ideas here
  would be greatly appreciated</p>
