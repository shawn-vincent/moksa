<h3>March 4, 2014: Updated to Java 1.7</h3>

  <p>So I brought this thing back to life, mostly out of nostalgia.
  It's pretty cool: a complete Prolog environment written in Java.  It
  even has a parser written in Prolog that it bootstraps itself onto.

  <p>Worth playing around with if you've ever wondered how a Prolog
  compiler or runtime works.  It's a pretty clean implementation.

  <p>There are also some cool libraries it's built on top of,
  including some neato Java bytecode generation utilities (Smalljava);
  some mathematics libraries (smath) that do things like calculate
  dice distributions and throw errors on overflow of primitive
  expressions; and other goodies.


<h3>January 1, 2000: End of Life</h3>

  <p>I no longer have time to maintain or develop Moksa, having moved
  on to other projects.  The existing source code is available if you
  want to play with it.  <a href="mailto:svincent@svincent.com">Let me
  know</a> if you find it useful, or have any questions.</p>

<h2>What is this?</h2>

  <p>MoksaProlog is a toy Prolog interpreter written in Java.</p>

  <p>MoksaProlog is an offshoot of constraint programming research to
  do constraint-based RPG character generation.  I no longer have time
  to do this, so I've released MoksaProlog, in case anybody else would
  like to play with it.</p>

  <p>MoksaProlog compiles Prolog source into Java byte codes that run
  on a simple Warren's Abstract Machine (WAM).</p>

<h2>Greetings</h2>

  <p>Many greetings, weary game master.  Sit and rest a while.  I
  believe I may have good news. </p>

  <p>You look tired.  Have you been staying up late for weeks fleshing
  out every tavern in a massive country?  Rolling stats for every man
  in a king's army?  Do you like the idea of unbelievably overpowered
  gaming utilities?  Then, sirrah, you have come to the right
  place. </p>

  <p>Welcome to the home of Moksa, a new gaming utility.  Written
  entirely in Java, it uses techniques from sophisticated computer
  science and engineering to solve many of the problems of random
  gaming content once and for all. </p>

  <p>Moksa started as an effort to create a useful character generator
  for the Advanced Dungeons&amp;Dragons gaming system.  It has become
  much more than that. </p>

  <p>Moksa is being actively developed.  Currently, it exists as an
  implementation of ISO-standard Prolog.  However, it will be extended
  with constraint solving facilities over fuzzy sets, and become a
  remarkably powerful tool for generating random content.</p>
