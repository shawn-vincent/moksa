<p>An implementation of a Warren's Abstract Machine and associated
builtin predicates, to conform to ISO Prolog.</p>

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>

<p>The API is still very much in flux: more will be written about it
in this documentation as it solidifies.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>MoksaProlog is built on top of a Warren's Abstract Machine (WAM),
an implementation of Prolog designed by David Warren in 1983.  I don't
have the time, inclination, or skill to describe how the WAM
functions.  Luckily, there's a <a
href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~hak/documents/wam.html">book</a> you can
read that does that.  I can only describe what I did.</p>

<p>That said, I hope that my source is self evident: I try to document
any tricky bits, in the hope that MoksaProlog can be used as a means
by which people can figure out how to write a Prolog environment for
themselves, particularly in an object-oriented language like Java.</p>

<p>The biggest single difference, and the trickiest thing in
MoksaProlog's implementation, is <em>continuation passing</em>.</p>

<h3>So what's continuation passing?</h3>

<p>A <strong>continuation</strong> is an additional parameter to every
function in the system that tells the function what to do when it's
done.  This is implemented in MoksaProlog by an additional register in
the machine called <code>continuation</code>, of type
<code>Continuation</code>.</p>

<p>If you look at the <code>Continuation</code> class, you'll see
what's stored in it: it owns the next <code>Rule</code> to invoke
(which is our only pointer to instructions that we have in
MoksaProlog), the values of the argument registers to pass this
<code>Rule</code> when invoking it, and the <code>Continuation</code>
to pass the <code>Rule</code>, so that it knows what to do next.</p>

<p>Every <code>Rule</code> in the system is responsible, then, for
returning a <Code>Continuation</Code> instance of the thing to do
<em>next</em>.  Often, this new <Code>Continuation</Code> is a
function of the <Code>Continuation</Code> that was passed into the
<code>Rule</code>.</p>

<p>Let's look at some example cases, to try and make things
clearer:</p>

<ul>
   <li>If the <code>Rule</code> wants to call another
   <code>Rule</code>, it makes a new <Code>Continuation</Code>
   consisting of the function to be called, its arguments, and a
   <Code>Continuation</Code> telling the function where to go when its
   done.
      <ul>
         <li>If the called <code>Rule</code> is the last thing we do,
         then we pass it the <Code>Continuation</Code> that was passed
         to us.</li>

         <li>If we want to do something after we call the
         <code>Rule</code>, we pass the <code>Rule</code> a
         <Code>Continuation</Code> containing the thing we want to do
         (which will, in turn, probably contain the
         <Code>Continuation</Code> that was passed to us)</li>
      </ul>
   </li>

   <li>If the <code>Rule</code> just wants to return, it returns the
   <Code>Continuation</Code> passed into it.</li>

   <li>If the <code>Rule</code> wants to fail, it returns a
   <Code>Continuation</Code> with a call to the 'fail'
   <code>Rule</code>: typically done by returning the global instance
   <code>wam.Fail</code>.  This is one of the only
   <Code>Continuation</Code>s that can be reused globally this way,
   since Fail ignores the <Code>Continuation</Code> passed to it.</li>

   <li>If the <code>Rule</code> wants to throw an exception, it
   returns a <Code>Continuation</Code> with a call to the 'throw'
   <code>Rule</code>.  This is typically done by calling the method
   <code>Wam.callThrow</code>, which constructs such a
   <Code>Continuation</Code>..</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that it is possible to pass 'null' in as the
<Code>Continuation</Code>.  If you do this, and that ever executes,
then the machine will halt (this is the termination case for the
machine, currently)</p>

<p>Hopefully, that helps a bit.  There are other discussions of
continuation passing programming in most good programming language
design/implementation books.</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>My name is <a href="http://www.svincent.com/">Shawn Vincent</a>:
I'm a professional systems programmer, specializing in Java.  Moksa is
something I do in my spare time: it has no particular connection or
distance from my work life, at <a
href="http://www.meteko.com/">Meteko</a> (which has a very cool
product, by the way).</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>Vital to any software's success is the help of nice people the
world over.  Many people have had a part in allowing MoksaProlog to be
released, and I'll never be able to thank them all.</p>

<p>The single biggest contributer to MoksaProlog has got to be <a
href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~hak/">Hassan A&iuml;t-Kaci</a>, the
author of the book: <em>Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial
Reconstruction</em>, originally published by MIT press.  If it weren't
for this book, I'd never have been able to figure out how the WAM
works, and how to write one.  The book itself is out of print, but
Hassan has made it available for noncommercial use: you can download
it in various formats from <a
href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~hak/documents/wam.html">his web
site</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking about books, the book that caused me to walk the path of
Prolog in my journeys with Moksa was <a
href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~pjs/book/book.html"><em>Programming with
Constraints: an Introduction</em></a>, by Kim Marriott and Peter
J. Stuckey.  It is an excellent book, well worth reading if you're
interested in this stuff.  This book will also come in handy later on
when I'm adding constraint processing support for Moksa.</p>

<p>Also, all my teachers at the <a
href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, all my
colleagues that I've worked with in the programming industry over the
years, my friends: everybody who has influenced my programming style,
increasing my skill, and teaching me techniques: MoksaProlog would not
have been possible without your help.</p>
