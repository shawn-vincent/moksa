<p>Provides an API for generating Java source code and JVM bytecodes.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Smalljava was motivated by my attempts to write an efficient and
elegant Prolog environment in Java, work on which is ongoing.  I
decided that what I wanted to do was automatically generate bytecode
from Prolog predicates, and execute the bytecode directly, thereby
gaining all the benefits of all the JIT and HotSpot engineers in my
own code.</p>

<p>However, generating JVM code is slow and tedious.  Working with
assembly language has been largely abandoned by the computer industry
for good reason!  So, I wanted a tool that could act as a simple
backend for my Prolog environment.  Thus arose Smalljava.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Smalljava is based on a subset of Java, called Smalljava.
Smalljava is pretty much exactly a Java compiler with a few
hard-to-implement language features removed, such as overload
resolution.  As a result, it's way more tedious to program in
Smalljava than in Java, but as a compiler backend, it works
gloriously, as you can use high-level programming constructs like
loops and control structures, and Smalljava will happily compile the
code into bytecodes.</p>

<p>Another thing that comes out of this approach is a feature which
may or may not be useful.  Since Smalljava is very similar to Java, it
was the work of a few moments to allow it to generate Java source as
well as JVM code.  This way, the back end of your favorite compiler
environment can generate source code: either to debug the compiler
(the JVM code is awfully hard to read), or for other, more insidious
purposes (you tell me).</p>

<h2>Using Smalljava</h2>

<p>The basic mode of use of Smalljava is as follows.  First, create a
Smalljava data structure, representing a Smalljava class, using the
provided builder APIs.  Call a {@link
com.svincent.smalljava.SmallClass#finalize() finalize} method on the
data structure, and call a method to spew as Java source or as JVM
bytecode.  Nothing could be simpler.</p>

<p>You need an example?  Well, there is one example in {@link
com.svincent.smalljava.SmallClass#main SmallClass}, but another one
is given here, just to be nice.</p>

<pre>
{
  SmallClass c = new SmallClass ("Dog");
  c.instanceField ("Ljava.lang.String;", "name");

  SmallMethod getName =
    c.method ("getName()Ljava.lang.String;", Util.EmptyStringArray);

  // ... define getName ...

  SmallMethod setName =
    c.method ("setName(Ljava.lang.String;)V", new String[] {"_name"});
  setName.add (new Expr.AssignField ("Dog", "Ljava.lang.String;", "name", 
                                     new Expr.GetLocal (setName, "_name")));

  // --- finalize the class.                                    
  c.finalize ();

  // --- write as a Java program.
  c.writeAsJava ("Dog.java");

  // --- write as a classfile
  c.writeAsBytecodes ("Dog.class");
}
</pre>

<p>The class generated will be the same as the following class</p>

<pre>
public class Dog extends java.lang.Object
{
  String name;

  public Dog () { super (); }
  public String getName () { /* ... define getName ... */ }
  public void setName (String _setName) { name = _name; }
}
</pre>

<h2>Where do I start?</h2>

<p>The best place to start using Smalljava is probably the {@link
com.svincent.smalljava.SmallClass SmallClass} class.  The builder API
and examples are largely self-explanatory.</p>

<h2>This is crap!  How do I complain!?</h2>

<p>Although I try to maintain the highest standards of quality in my
programming, occassionally, things slip by.  If you have any
complaints about Smalljava, or have suggestions about where you'd like
to see it taken, you can <a href="mailto:svincent@svincent.com">send
me mail</a>, and I'll promise to give your ideas careful
consideration.</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>

<p>Smalljava and all its related libraries are being released by me
under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License</a>.  See the license for more information.  The <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/">Main GNU website</a> has lots more
information about free software, if you're interested.</p>

<h2>Future directions</h2>

<p>Eventually, I'd like to put a parser front-end onto Smalljava, so
you don't have to build the data structures by hand.  Overloading will
probably also eventually be implemented, but don't hold your
breath.</p>

<p>More short-term, I intend to write a ClassLoader for SmallJava, so
that in addition to spewing Java source and JVM classfiles, SmallJava
classes can be run more or less directly.  Some engineering effort
will have to go into this before I'm all done.  This is definitely
going to happen, as I need this functionality for my Prolog
environment.</p>
