

Want to build data structure, generate bytecodes/java code from it.

data structure should be parseable from a limited subset/variant of the
Java language. (Call it Smalljava?)

Maybe ultimately put a Java front end on it, as well.


Examples of Smalljava code:

   com/svincent/util/Util.out->println(I)V (32);
   
   int i;
   for (i=0; i<20; i++)
     {
       com/svincent/util/Util.out->println(I)V (i);
     }

   this->foo(Lcom/svincent/util/Util)V (x);
